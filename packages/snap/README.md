This project extends Metamask capabilities to include support for Astar & Shiden,
and other Substrate- and FRAME-based blockchains in the Polkadot ecosystem.

## What are Snaps?

> Snaps is a system that allows anyone to safely extend the capabilities of
> MetaMask. A snap is a program that [Metamask runs] in an isolated environment
> that can customize the wallet experience.
>
> For example, a snap can add new APIs to MetaMask, add support for different
> blockchain protocols, or modify existing functionality using internal APIs.
> Snaps is a new way to create web3 end user experiences, by modifying MetaMask
> in ways that were impossible before.

Learn more about snaps from the
[official Metamask documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html).

**As of 2022-10-01, snaps are only supported in
[Metamask's developer build, Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/).**
